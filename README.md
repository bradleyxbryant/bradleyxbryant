Hi, I’m Bradley Bryant. I use data to understand how businesses operate and where performance can improve. My background is in business analytics, with experience in forecasting, modeling, and dashboarding.



## Projects

### [Customer Response Prediction](https://github.com/bradleyxbryant/Customer-Response-Prediction)
Built predictive models in Python to identify customers most likely to respond to marketing campaigns. Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest models on a 2,240-record CRM dataset, achieving an AUC of 0.88. Results informed campaign targeting decisions and resource allocation.

- Cleaned CRM data through imputation, feature engineering, and standardization
- Tuned probability thresholds to balance precision versus recall
- Translated model outputs into actionable targeting insights
  
Skills: Python • Pandas • Scikit-Learn • Predictive Modeling • Feature Engineering



### [Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/bradleyxbryant/portfolio_optimization)
Developed a $10,000 portfolio optimization model in Excel to evaluate diversification strategies and risk-adjusted performance. Applied constraint-based allocation to compare portfolio outcomes under uncertainty.

- Built a 40-stock allocation model with diversification constraints
- Applied Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate risk exposure
- Performed sensitivity analysis to support investment decisions

Skills: Excel Solver • Optimization • Monte Carlo Simulation • Risk Analysis
