Hi, I’m Bradley Bryant — a Business Analytics student focused on supply chain, operations, and data-driven decision-making.
I use analytics, forecasting, and optimization to improve operational performance and support smarter planning.



## Projects

### [Customer Response Prediction](https://github.com/bradleyxbryant/Customer-Response-Prediction)
Built a predictive model in Python to identify demand signals and forecast customer response. Achieved 0.88 AUC using Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
#Key components:
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and standardization
- Threshold tuning to balance precision/recall
- Business focused insights for resource allocation

Skills: Python • Pandas • Scikit-Learn • Predictive Modeling • Feature Engineering



### [Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/bradleyxbryant/portfolio_optimization)
Developed a $10K portfolio optimization model to analyze risk, diversification, and scenario outcomes. Used Sharpe ratio, Monte Carlo simulations, and constraints similar to supply-chain risk planning.
#Key components:
- 40-stock allocation under capacity/diversification constraints
- Monte Carlo simulations for scenario uncertainty
- Sensitivity analysis for decision making

Skills: Excel Solver • Optimization • Monte Carlo Simulation • Risk Analysis
